            IHP is a new batteries-included web framework optimized for longterm productivity and programmer happiness.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            With IHP all your application code is written in Haskell - a functional programming with an incredible type system, used by giants such as <a href="https://github.com/github/semantic" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/security/fighting-spam-with-haskell/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Thanks to Haskell's impressive type system you can write code that is far more robust than you have seen before.

        <q>I have been learning Haskell through IHP. It's the best and actually simplest web framework I have ever tried. The developer experience is the best I ever had for a MVC-style framework. And I got to learn Haskell without banging my head too much against the wall. Really enjoyed it :)</q>

                    <strong>Instant Live Reloading:</strong>

                    <p>While haskell is a compiled language, the built-in dev server automatically reloads your code changes using the fastest way possible. Changes are reflected instantly. Just like good old PHP.</p>

                    <p>Like React's JSX. Write html code in your haskell files. This will be transformed to actual type-checked haskell code at compile time.</p>

                    <p>Setup of the fully-managed dev environment takes just 5 minutes. All  dependencies (even database and compiler) are managed using the nix package manager. This means dependency problems just cannot occur anymore. Also everything is guaranteed to be same for all developers in your team.</p>

                <li>

                    <p>Code Generators will help you to quickly build things even when you have no professional haskell experience yet. Pick up haskell by building real world applications.</p>
