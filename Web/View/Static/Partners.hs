                Based in Limerick City, Ireland
                Comhlan is a young company focused on the design of quality software.
                The name Comhlan comes from the Irish word for complete:
                chosen because, at the end of a project,
                our clients will have the tools they need to do their job.
                IHP is the primary tool Comhlan reaches for to make this happen.
                Comhlan is an active contributor to the IHP framework
                and deploys IHP applications in production.
