<p>
Thereâ€™s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and itâ€™s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. Thatâ€™s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
Itâ€™s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don''t trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function''s type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to itâ€™s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 itâ€™s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> thereâ€™s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like itâ€™s finally ready to conquer the world.

<p>The quality of GHC''s error messages is making it harder for newcomers to adopt Haskell. A good error message should be clear, actionable, and practical. In this aspect GHC could be a lot more user-friendly.</p>

<p>Here''s an example related to type-level-list syntax that often comes up in the IHP community:</p>

<pre>
action CreateUserAction = do
        let user = newRecord @User
        let password = param @Text "password"
        user
            |> set #passwordHash password
            |> fill @["email"]
            |> validateField #email isEmail
            |> validateField #passwordHash nonEmpty
            |> debug
            |> ifValid \case
            Left user ->
                render NewView {..}
            Right user -> do
                hashed <- hashPassword (get #passwordHash user)
                user
                    |> set #passwordHash hashed
                    |> createRecord

                setSuccessMessage "You have successfully registered"
</pre>

<p>This code snippet errors with:</p>

<pre>
Web/Controller/Users.hs:16:23
    * Expected a type, but `"email"'' has kind `Symbol''
    * In the type `["email"]''
      In the second argument of `(|>)'', namely `fill @["email"]''
      In the first argument of `(|>)'', namely
        `user |> set #passwordHash password |> fill @["email"]''
   |
16 |             |> fill @["email"]
   |                       ^^^^^^^
</pre>

<p>Unless you know about the type-level-list syntax issue with <code>''</code> you will most likely get stuck.</p>

<p>A better error message could offer a solution that will most likely help:</p>

<pre>
Web/Controller/Users.hs:16:23
    * Type level lists with only a single element need a '' in front of the list. Prepend a '' like `''["email]'' to get it working.
    * In the type `["email"]''
      In the second argument of `(|>)'', namely `fill @["email"]''
      In the first argument of `(|>)'', namely
        `user |> set #passwordHash password |> fill @["email"]''
   |
16 |             |> fill @["email"]
   |                       ^^^^^^^

  '
<p><em>by Jannis Jorre, 03.03.2021</em></p>

<p>
express is one of the most popular options for writing webapps these days. IHP on the other hand is the fastest growing Haskell web framework.
</p>

<p>
If you''ve been using express, this article is supposed to give you an intro into all of the good stuff you might be missing out on.
</p>

<h2>Live Reloading</h2>
<p>
express and related tooling are notoriously known for the fact that to start any project, one will first have to do a lot of configuring to get nice developer tooling set up, but also to get everything running at all.
</p>

<p>
IHP works on a different ideology: at digitally induced, we aim to make software engineering feel magical again. As such, configuration is turned down to a minimum, while providing the best developer tools out-of-the-box.
</p>

<p>
One such tool is live reloading. While you can get some form of automatic server restarts on file save set up with express, it''ll take a while to configure everything properly. And in the end, states will likely not be preserved. Additionally, and webpage that''s been opened that requires reloading will have to be reloaded by hand (unless you want to spend multiple hours with configuration again).
</p>

<p>
When using IHP, all of that is done for you. Whatever you change - whether that''s frontend code, or backend code - it''ll only require you to save the file for you to see the result in your browser, as the included developer tools reload everything for you. Even better, the website doesn''t even have to do a full reload - instead, only the parts of the page are updated that actually need updating.
</p>

<h2>Websockets and Auto Refresh</h2>
<p>
So live reload is great for developing, but there''s a similar situation in production apps too: if the data on the server changes, we might want to update what''s shown in an already opened website. When using express, you''ll have to do some ajax to get that to work.
</p>

<p>
With IHP, all the necessary tools are included to set up a websocket connection to the client very easily. If you happened to build a webapp using express instead, you''ll have to pick up a second library for that, and coordinate between the two.
</p>

<p>
However, since most websocket connections are used for the same thing (updating what the client sees based on changing information from the server), IHP makes it even simpler for developers: it''s got auto refresh.
</p>

<p>
By simply setting an action (the equivalent of a route) to have auto refresh enabled, any changes will be pushed to all open clients via a websocket connection whenever the database has updated data for the relevant page.
</p>

<p>
It''ll literately require you to do nothing more than type <code>autoRefresh</code> before the code of the route. That''s 11 letters. And you''re done.
</p>

<h2>Code generators</h2>
<p>
Speaking of saving keystrokes: in projects there tends to be some amount of boilerplate. And that''s really annoying to type. With IHP, typing boilerplate is a thing of the past. Code generators allow you to generate everything that''s not specific to your implementation, which means it takes seconds to get set up for new features.
</p>

<p>
If you use the web ui instead of the CLI to do the code generation, you even get nice syntax-highlighted previews of what will be generated, so you can make sure everything works as expected. But honestly, I''ve never had a case where it didn''t do what I wanted it to.
</p>

<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
<p>
JavaScript is seeing a big move towards the paradigm of functional programming. Routes are simply functions in express, React is is defaulting to function components, and functions like <code>filter</code>, <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> are all becoming more and more popular.
</p>

<p>
Since IHP uses Haskell - a purely functional programming language - you get all of that goodness too. Only better, because it''s the whole concept of Haskell.
</p>

<p>
Being purely functional has other advantages than just being trending though. Pure functions do not have side effects. When something does go wrong, it''s really easy to find out where to look for the error, because there''s only a handful of places the bug could hide. While in express it could be nearly everywhere. The reason for this is that reasoning about the things a function does by just looking at its type signature is really easy. Speaking of which...
</p>

<h2>Type-safety</h2>
<p>
JavaScript is a weakly and dynamically typed language. Haskell on the other hand is strongly and statically typed. That means that while JavaScript allows you to use any variable everywhere (even one that hasn''t even been created before), Haskell will make sure that whatever variable is being used, makes sense at that place.
</p>

<p>
Lots of people will say that dynamic and weak typing have advantages, and that''s certainly true - there''s definitely situations in which it is advantageous. But in most cases, there''s only a limited subset of values that make sense, and that''s where strong, static typing will prevent a whole host of bugs. Just look at the popularity of typescript, which attempts to bring strong, static typing to JavaScript. Since it''s tacked-on it isn''t as expressive as Haskell''s type system, which has been developed for years and years already.
</p>

<p>
If you''re a Javascript developer and find writing typescript code annoying, I fully understand you. While typescript is great in its idea to bring strong, static typing to the web, it is lacking good type inference. That means that most people will have to write long, complicated type definitions by hand. In most cases Haskell will infer the type for you, meaning you get all the benefits, without the costs.
</p>

<p>
The result is a language that will show you lots of bugs before you even run your code. You see lots of people saying they''d rather have code not compile for hours, instead of compiling and having to hunt down unnoticed bugs for days. And that''s exactly what Haskell can do for you. Just try it, and you''ll learn to love the compiler.
</p>

<h2>Faster performance thanks to Haskell green-threads</h2>
<p>
Speaking of compiling. It''s well-known that compiled languages tend to be faster than interpreted languages. That is another reason to use IHP, as Haskell will make your web app faster without you having to do anything, just because you use Haskell. Since express is running on Javascript, which is an interpreted language, it''s very hard to get a get performance.
</p>

<p>
To increase performance, multithreading is a useful tool that allows a developer to get big bang for your buck. That is, if you''re able to use it. Which you won''t be if you use express, since Javascript is a single-threaded language.
</p>

<p>
Sure, there''s async-await and promises, but everything still stays in one thread. Which makes reasoning about your program easy, but it doesn''t allow you to get as performant as you otherwise could be.
</p>

<p>
When using Haskell, you have it much easier. Multithreading is already done for you. You won''t have to reason about race conditions and all those complicated situations that could arise by using async-await. Instead, the Haskell compiler is smart enough to multi-thread the parts of your application using something called green threads, without you having to do anything - and you will not run into any reasoning issues because of it. It basically is a free performance boost!
</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>
Due to its popularity, deploying express applications has never been easier. At digitally induced we understand that, which is why we''ve built <a href="https://ihpcloud.com/">ihp-cloud</a>. It''s as simple as creating a git repository and telling us where to find it, and your repository can be deployed.
</p>

<h2>Community</h2>
<p>
No doubt, express has a great community and lots of documentation. IHP''s community is quickly growing too, however, and you''ll always find help in our community slack at <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Slack">https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Slack</a>, where we from digitally induced (the company behind IHP) will do everything to assist you in getting started with IHP and Haskell.
